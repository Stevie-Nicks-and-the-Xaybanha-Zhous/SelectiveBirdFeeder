The objective is to use a microcontroller to only release seed if the microphone is activated above a threshold frequency and the weight sensor feels a weight less than the threshold, above which is assumed to be a crow or squirrel.

The device will use a processing module to automatically dispense bird feed when a small bird is "detected". This is coded using a microcontroller to output a PWM which activates the servo to release seed based on the inputs sensed by the microphone activate with a chirp above the frequency threshold and a strain gauge sensor with a voltage related to the weight on the sensor below the weight threshold.
